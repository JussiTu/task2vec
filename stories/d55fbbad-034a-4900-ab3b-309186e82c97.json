  "narrative": "The assignee has been actively contributing since June 2019, focusing on various themes throughout their work. In the early phase, they primarily tackled flaky test issues, as seen in tickets like ZOOKEEPER-3455 and ZOOKEEPER-3470, while also addressing Maven and release cleanup. Moving into the middle phase, they shifted their attention to Zookeeper leader connection issues, with notable tickets such as ZOOKEEPER-3725 and ZOOKEEPER-3756, alongside handling SASL and Kerberos authentication issues. Recently, their work has centered on backporting for branches 3.5 and 3.6, highlighted by tickets like ZOOKEEPER-3810 and ZOOKEEPER-3865, while still managing connection issues. Overall, 55% of their steps aligned with the overall direction, demonstrating a strong commitment to project goals."
