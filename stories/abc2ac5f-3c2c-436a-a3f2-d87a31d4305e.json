  "narrative": "The assignee has been actively contributing since March 2019, focusing primarily on code cleanup and refactoring. In the early phase, they worked on tasks such as ZOOKEEPER-3335 and ZOOKEEPER-3338, which emphasized improving code quality. As they progressed into the middle phase, their efforts continued to center around code cleanup, with notable tickets like ZOOKEEPER-3663 and ZOOKEEPER-3671, while also addressing log improvements. Recently, they maintained this focus, tackling additional code cleanup tasks, including ZOOKEEPER-3693 and ZOOKEEPER-3835. Throughout their work, they also engaged in log improvement and cleanup, as seen in tickets like ZOOKEEPER-3708. Overall, 56% of their steps aligned with the overall direction of the project."
